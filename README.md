# 🐦 Avian Intel Bridge - Bird Strike Detection System

## 🌟 Overview
The Avian Intelligence Bridge is a cutting-edge bird detection and communication analysis system designed for airport safety. It combines multiple AI models to identify, analyze, and interpret bird behavior in real time, with a special focus on high-risk species in airport environments. 

**(This project was developed for the FutureHack Hackathon and successfully made it into the Top 10 finalists🌞)**
